# Bug Bounty AI Workflow

## Overview

This project aims to create an autonomous bug bounty hunter that can scan for vulnerabilities, generate reports, and submit findings across multiple platforms. The system will use automation, AI, and open-source tools to identify security bugs, analyze them, and submit bug bounty reports, with an initial focus on high-reward vulnerabilities ($500-$1000).

### Phases:
- **Phase 1:** Set up the basic framework for scanning bug bounty platforms, identifying vulnerabilities, and generating reports.
- **Phase 2:** Integrate AI (Reinforcement Learning) to optimize the process.
- **Phase 3:** Enhance the system to discover zero-day exploits.

## Workflow

1. **Scrape for Bounties:** Automatically search for bug bounties on various platforms, filtering by criteria such as reward size and vulnerability type.
   
2. **Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Use open-source tools (e.g., Burp Suite, Nmap, OWASP ZAP) to identify security issues.

3. **Generate Reports:** Automatically generate reports using AI (LLMs) to document the findings.

4. **Compliance Check:** Ensure all actions are ethical and within bug bounty platform guidelines.

5. **Submit Reports:** Automatically submit findings to the respective platforms.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Tools:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT for report generation
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup, Selenium
