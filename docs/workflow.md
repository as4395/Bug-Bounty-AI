# System Workflow

This document describes the step-by-step workflow of the **Bug Bounty AI Workflow** system.

## Step 1: Scrape Bug Bounty Listings

- Use *beautifulsoup4*, *selenium*, and *requests* to scrape bug bounty opportunities from multiple platforms.
- Filter listings based on criteria such as reward size, vulnerability type, or program scope.

## Step 2: Scan Targets

- Pass scraped targets to **Nmap** and **pyshodan** for automated vulnerability scanning.
- Collect structured scan outputs for further analysis.

## Step 3: Generate Reports

- Process scan data using *pandas* and *numpy*.
- Use **OpenAI GPT** to generate readable, well-structured bug reports summarizing key findings.

## Step 4: Check Compliance

- Run checks to ensure all findings and activities adhere to each platformâ€™s legal and ethical guidelines.
- Use predefined rules from the `/configs` folder to flag or adjust any violations.

## Step 5: Submit Reports

- Use *requests_oauthlib* to prepare and optionally submit reports to the respective bug bounty platforms.
- Save drafts or submission logs in the `/submissions` folder.

## Step 6: Manage via Flask Interface

- Provide a user-friendly interface or API using the **Flask** framework.
- Allow users to trigger scans, view reports, monitor progress, and manage system settings through the web interface.
