# Phase Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap for the **Bug Bounty AI Workflow** project.

## Phase 1: Core System Setup

- Scrape bug bounty listings using *beautifulsoup4*, *selenium*, and *requests*.
- Automate vulnerability scanning with **Nmap** and **pyshodan**.
- Generate structured reports using **OpenAI GPT** and *pandas*.
- Provide a **Flask** web interface for managing scans and reports.

## Phase 2: AI Optimization

- Integrate a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize scans.
- Prioritize high-reward targets and improve efficiency.
- Tune system parameters to maximize bug discovery.
- Monitor AI performance and adjust strategies as needed.

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

- Develop modules for zero-day exploit discovery.
- Add advanced detection and analysis techniques.
- Strengthen safeguards for legal and ethical compliance.
- Expand automation to cover more platforms and bug types.
