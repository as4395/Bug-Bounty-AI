# System Architecture

The **Bug Bounty AI Workflow** system is designed as a modular, automated pipeline for discovering, analyzing, and reporting security vulnerabilities across bug bounty platforms.

## High-Level Components

1. **Scraper**  
   Collects bug bounty listings from various platforms using tools like *beautifulsoup4*, *selenium*, and *requests*.

2. **Scanner**  
   Scans identified targets for vulnerabilities using **Nmap** and **pyshodan**, producing structured scan data.

3. **Report Generator**  
   Uses **OpenAI GPT** and *pandas* to generate clear, structured bug reports summarizing findings.

4. **Compliance Checker**  
   Ensures that all actions and findings comply with each platformâ€™s rules and ethical guidelines.

5. **Submitter**  
   Prepares and optionally submits reports to bug bounty programs, assisted by *requests_oauthlib* for secure submission.

6. **Flask Framework**
   Provides a web-based interface or API for interacting with the system.
